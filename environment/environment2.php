                        The Department of Environment and Natural Resources should scrap its partnership with Shell
                        Pilipinas Corp. and demand the fossil fuel company to pay reparations for contributing to the
                        climate crisis, an environmental group said Thursday.<br><br>

                        Greenpeace Philippines criticized the collaboration between the DENR and Shell to identify and
                        develop nature-based solutions, calling it a “reprehensible partnership” and a “slap on the
                        face” of Filipinos impacted by the climate crisis.<br><br>

                        “[The DENR needs] to be reminded that their job is to be on the side of Filipino communities,
                        not the companies who are responsible for climate change in the first place,” Greenpeace
                        campaigner Khevin Yu said.<br><br>

                        “Secretary [Antonia] Loyzaga should tell Shell that if they are sincere in helping the
                        environment and people, they must stop fossil fuel expansion and pay Filipino reparations for
                        losses and damages from climate impacts,” he added.<br><br>

                        In a landmark report released in 2022, the Commission on Human Rights said the willful
                        obfuscation of fossil fuel and cement companies of the risks posed by climate change and the
                        obstruction for efforts toward a global transition to renewable energy are immoral.<br><br>

                        The CHR report stemmed from the petition filed by civil society organizations and typhoon
                        survivors in 2015, which asked the commission to investigate the responsibilities of carbon
                        majors such as Shell, Chevron, Exxon, BP and Total for the economic and human costs caused by
                        climate change.<br><br>

                        In February, members of communities affected by fossil fuel operations and extreme weather
                        events demanded climate reparations from Shell and other carbon majors—or the world’s most
                        polluting companies.<br><br>

                        <b>'Greenwashing'?</b><br>

                        “To the DENR […] what kind of DENR do you want yourself to be remembered as? An agency that
                        fought for the human right to a clean, safe, and healthy environment, or one that succumbed to
                        the interests of a few and enabled the accelerated destruction of our planet?” said Jairus
                        Ismael Chiu, a youth climate leader from Bohol.<br><br>

                        Under the memorandum of agreement signed in May, the environment department and the oil and gas
                        company will explore integrated carbon and development opportunities. They will document
                        processes and activities that can be used as future reference in developing related programs and
                        policies.<br><br>

                        The collaboration is seen to support the government’s ambitious National Greening Program
                        through the restoration and protection of unproductive and denuded forestlands.<br><br>

                        Loyzaga was quoted as saying in a Shell release that collaboration is “significant.”<br><br>

                        “We all have a stewardship role in terms of protecting our national resources, and we deeply
                        value this opportunity to work together to achieve our goals for a climate and
                        disaster-resilient country and planet,” Loyzaga said.<br><br>
