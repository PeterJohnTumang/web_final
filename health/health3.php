                    <p>
                        Elon Musk’s brain-implant company Neuralink on Thursday, May 25, said it had received a green
                        light from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to kickstart its first-in-human clinical
                        study, a critical milestone after earlier struggles to gain approval.<br><br>

                        The FDA nod “represents an important first step that will one day allow our technology to help
                        many people,” Neuralink said in a tweet. It did not elaborate on the aims of the study, saying
                        only that it was not recruiting yet and more details would be available soon.<br><br>

                        The FDA acknowledged in a statement that the agency cleared Neuralink to use its brain implant
                        and surgical robot for trials on patients but declined to provide more details.<br><br>

                        Neuralink and Musk did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.<br><br>

                        Victor Krauthamer, an adjunct biomedical engineering professor who spent three decades at the
                        FDA, including a stint overseeing the office that reviews human-trial requests for brain
                        implants, said the FDA does not typically inspect facilities as part of their review of
                        applications for clinical trials. But he added this would have been warranted in this case,
                        given the concerns around Neuralink’s animal experiments.<br><br>

                        “If the animal testing is unreliable, then (human trial) approval may be based on flawed animal
                        safety data. The FDA should have verified their trust of animal study results,” Krauthamer
                        said.<br><br>

                        <b>Several predictions</b><br>

                        Neuralink had hoped to receive approval to implant its device in 10 patients, Reuters has
                        reported. But more recently, the company was negotiating a lower number of patients with the
                        agency after it raised safety concerns, current and former employees said. It is not known how
                        many patients the FDA ultimately approved.<br><br>

                        Musk envisions brain implants could cure a range of conditions including obesity, autism,
                        depression and schizophrenia as well as enabling Web browsing and telepathy. He made headlines
                        late last year when he said he was so confident in the devices’ safety that he would be willing
                        to implant them in his children.<br><br>

                        On at least four occasions since 2019, Musk predicted Neuralink would begin human trials. But
                        the company sought FDA approval only in early 2022, and the agency rejected the application,
                        Reuters reported in March.<br><br>

                        The FDA had pointed out several safety concerns to Neuralink that needed to be addressed before
                        sanctioning human trials, Reuters reported. Some of the issues involved the lithium battery of
                        the device, the possibility of the implant’s wires migrating within the brain, and the challenge
                        of safely extracting the device without damaging brain tissue.<br><br>
